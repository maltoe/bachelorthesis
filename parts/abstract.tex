One of the major problems in the chemistry domain is the need for combining data
from a multitude of heterogeneous data sources and formats that complicate
chemical eScience research. Data Integration is a tedious process that often
leads to duplication and inconsistencies amongst the data. The Semantic Web and
the more recent development of the Linked Data Cloud have made large amounts of
structured chemical information available on the Internet and developed new
methods for semantic data integration that have proven to be efficient on a
large scale. We are  exploring ways in which companies can use semantic
technologies and the information available in eScience Information Clouds in
order to enrich their data towards semantic knowledge and to enhance their
existing products with improved semantic search capabilities.
