In theory, the performance impact of a cache line split should not be any worse than that of an unaligned access. However, an interesting blog entry~\cite{glaser2008cachelinesplits} of x264 developer Jason Garrett-Glaser suggests that cache line splits result in costly penalties on some Intel architectures (e.g., Core 2). Glaser carries on with explaining several SSE-related techniques to circumvent these penalties.
