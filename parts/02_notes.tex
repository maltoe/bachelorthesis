\section{Notes}
\begin{verbatim}
interesting topics:

* benchmarking
** time measurement (clock_gettime / rdtsc)
** callgrind
** Different input values can lead to different perfomance!
	 --> maybe define a huge set of test data to calculate average speed up

* intrinsics
** vs. inline asm

* gcc
** compiler flags
*** optimization level
** what happens to intrinsics?
** a little asm
*** rip relative addressing
** auto vectorization
** unlikely()

* RCS: Use branches a lot.

* icc (?)
* Intel Software Development Emulator (?)

* manual vectorization
** 'streamlining' techniques
*** shuffle (?)
*** loop unrolling
*** data dependence?
** what to do with conditionals
*** and(one, cmp(x,y)) / blend
*** "branch prediction vs. blending" (?)
** aligned storage!
** streaming store instructions: movntps (?)
*** (Bypasses cache for storing registers to memory or for loading
    memory to registers. Useful for once-referenced, rarely used
    again data.)
** instruction prefetching wrt SSE
*** unnecessary on >=P4?
** instruction pairing
** how to avoid cache contention
** locality of reference? 
** maximize register usage (?)

* focus: new features of SSE4.x, AVX
** blend, blendv, test
** insert, extract
