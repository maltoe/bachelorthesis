As explained in section~\ref{ls2}, in real-world localization technologies, the distance is usually determined by measuring the round-trip time (RTT) of a signal (e.g., radio waves) travelling between the anchor node and the client. Multiplying this time with the (fixed) speed of the signal yields the estimated distance. Since obstacles (e.g., walls) in the signal's path can only decelerate its speed but not accelerate it, it is effectivly impossible to obtain too short RTTs, assuming the used clock is accurate.
