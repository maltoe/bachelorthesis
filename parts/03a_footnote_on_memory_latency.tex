In fact, memory access times depend on the internal clockings of the memory modules integrated in the computer as well as the clock frequency of the \emph{Front Side Bus} (FSB), which connects it to the CPU. In ``Principles of Computer Architecture''~\cite[p. 256]{murdocca1999computer} the access time is specified as 60-80 nanoseconds, whereas a register access costs only 1 nanosecond. Although the book is from the late 1990s and the data is likely to be outdated, the proportion should be still valid today.
